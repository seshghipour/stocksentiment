You assume Tesla the master of over promise under deliver will deliver  Hows the schedule on Cyber Truck or Roadster or full autonomous going  How about the k model didnt last long did it
Then you assume Ford will stand still You also assume that Fords driver assist system will not evolve even as its working with many partners on autonomous vehicles You also compare what will most likely Tesla be a super subcompact to Ford SUV
Then you assume that people will still value Teslas the same given their lackluster quality and reliability when compared to current competition MachE for example scores significantly higher on reliability than Tesla counterpart
As for margins Tesla has achieved those by rushing production delivering cars with inferior attention to detail sometimes missing parts cutting corners etc Thats not sustainable when faced with substantial competition First mover advantage affords you some leeway but that leeway is retracted once significant competition enters the market And ICE vehicles along with hybrids are not going to be gone off the market anytime soon Ford is profitable now and will be going forward Teslas margins will shrink as they are forced to compete at all trim levels Ford will continue to evolve
But worst of all your drivel you assume a daughter would only want a supper subcom car  Why not a Maverick EV pickup Just like your Tesla a Maverick fullEV is vaporware But since with all your assumptions Ill take the same latitude with mine or maybe an SUV would be the choice  And why did you choose daughter instead of son Because woman only need little dainty cars Or because you lack depth to your character and wanted to creat a cute story that is drivel wrap a cute bow around it and call it an point of discussion

But lets entertain it further Lets say Toyota can produce a decent number of EVs and in  somehow produce M not gonna happen but if they did theyre not stealing sales from Tesla Theyll be stealing sales from their Camry Corolla RAV and from the Honda Civic Accord CRV and from the Hyundai Sonata and all those Volkswagen gas cars Point is the EV market is going to explode and the victim wont be someone who depends on EVs for their business model The victim will be businesses that depend on ICE sales oh how ironic Toyota depends on ICE sales Tesla and probably  or  other EV companies will all sell every EV they make for the remainder of the decade","t3_rpqgft","Tesla",272,219,  0,  0,2

Who cares if Toyota is cannibalising their sales They are the biggest company with an incredible brand and customer loyalty a massive distribution chain that Tesla does not have As long as they convert those customers to new sales is all that matters

Tesla has the most to lose since it is yet to actually produce a decent profit Toyota has  years of experience in car manufacturing and Telsa is barely a teen Also hydrogen is not dead and is actually starting to attract serious attention as an alternative fuel energy intensive industry included So to suggest that Toyota wont catch up is laughable Once Hydrogen takes off it will be a superior technology to battery which still relies on fossil fuels to power it not to mention the limited supply of rare earth metals controlled mostly by China You think they are going to share Dont think so No such issues with Hydrogen","t3_rpqgft","Tesla",286,217,  0,  0,2

Some billionaires have lost it all like Bill Hwang

Theres also those who also got demoted down to millionaire status from billionaire status because they shorted the wrong businesses like Apple and Tesla

Then theres the Gamestop fiasco that literally costed shortsellers B of losses and M of those losses come from Gabe Plotkin 

Clearly the system does not always work for those at the top Plenty of small fries like us have made money by betting right taking massive capital from those people on top in a system that should have always worked in their favour

What in the hell are you talking about

Chewy was founded under the name Mr Chewy in June  by Ryan Cohen and Michael Day The company hired former employees and executives from Amazon PetSmart Whole Foods Market and Wayfair


It was bought out by Petsmart in 


They have a billion in YOUR cash you dipshit They played you all and took your money They got that money by adding  million shares which would absolutely FUCK any chance of a short squeeze But it lined the pockets of him and his billionaire friends who are just waiting to dump their shares and run


Look at it this way why would RC want a squeeze Think about it If the price squeezed and everyone sold in a day or so afterward it is going to go back down to preape levels   Which means he and his board paid exclusively through shares loses everything The company loses all that equity that you are so proud of up there in your comment Its market cap tanks and it gets yanked off its exchange and is almost immediately bankrupt Besides the fact that the worldwide economy would have crashed meaning no one is buying video games the dollar is worthless and what little money they still have left is likewise worthless


So there are two options if RC wants a squeeze its because he and his friends want to sell with the Apes dump their shares and thereby relinquish control of Gamestop as a company abandoning it He doesnt want the company to succeed he wants to get him money and run If he DOES want the company to succeed he doesnt want a squeeze because it will ruin the company and the world economy


Realistically what he did was a hostile takeover of Gamestop He can sell his shares in the next year and so hes keeping the cult hyped to keep the price up Once he sells hell liquidate the company making a profit on remaining assets and possibly sell whatever is left to a larger entity like Microsoft which will absorb it and use whatever is valuable to them Thats why there is no plan no announcements and no clear path forward from the company  they arent planning on being around for long They just want to try and keep it minimally profitable to increase the asking price when he sells later but investing any capital will just cut into the amount he can take when he golden parachutes out of there with his friends

The mRNA vaccines are a platform In theory the FDA should modify how it evaluates these vaccines because the formulation should be almost exactly the same from one vaccine to the next  with the difference being the frequency of each letter in the UACG letter code of the RNA 

So clinical trials need not focus on adverse effects as much as efficacy 

This is totally revolutionary to how pathogens can be combated and to certain motherinfant complications and a select few other diseases

“The vaccine protects against severe illness

During studies the three vaccines — Johnson amp Johnson Modern and Pfizer — have shown to be effective at preventing severe illness from COVID So even if you were vaccinated and become infected you are very unlikely to become severely ill The clinical trials for the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna vaccines showed they were  effective at preventing severe illness The Johnson amp Johnson vaccine showed  effectiveness against severe illness

The vaccines are also effective against variants Much like the original strand all three vaccines will protect you against severe illness and reduce the likelihood for hospitalization

Studies have shown vaccinated people who do get infected have mild to moderate cases of COVID compared to those who arent vaccinated So your risk of hospitalization and death because of COVID is nearly eliminated once you are fully vaccinated”","t3_rqj6u1","Moderna",802,200,  0,  0,2
