The purpose of this project is to create a basic architecture for scraping comments from the subreddit "[wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)". This project utilizes data gathered from the pushshift.io project - https://pushshift.io/ which aggregates large volumes of data from reddit for public use.

This project only scrapes data for the following tickers - DWAC, GME, MRNA, TSLA from the period of 12/23/20 - 12/23/21. This was done with the intent to look at a sample of volatile stocks and determine how reddit activity and sentiment was related to the price of these stocks. This motivation is built upon with the data generated from this architecture in my Tableau public profile - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shaheen1608#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0

This architecture can easily be extended to any number of stocks over any time range and with small tweaks could also be used to scrape any interesting information from reddit.
